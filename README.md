# Smart-lamp
In this project we created a lamp behaviour in C and Assembly language. For this, the program will be developed for the 8051 microcontroller and its simulation and programming will be done in Keil uVision.
# Objectives
To develop this work we have to create a code in C and Assembly language that is able to perform the following tasks. This program must be used on an 8051 microcontroller. The behavior of the lamp must be divided into three parts:
- First it should turn on and off when the button is clicked, like an ordinary lamp lamp;
- Secondly, the program must be able to change the intensity of the light, that is, at each touch of the button the intensity of the lamp will change;
- Finally, the lamp will have to respond to a sound stimulus, more precisely the clapping of hands, i.e., after the sequence of clapping it should turn the light on. If the sequence is made again it should turn off.

This is the architecture used:
